# Camomile

This is the version 1.0.0 release of Camomile library package. Camomile is a
Unicode library for ocaml. Camomile provides Unicode character type, UTF-8,
UTF-16, UTF-32 strings, conversion to/from about 200 encodings, collation and
locale-sensitive case mappings, and more.

The library is licensed under LGPL-2 with the common linking exception given to
OCaml packages. See [LICENSE.md][LICENSE.md]

1. Installation

To build and install Camomile, you need
OCaml >= 4.02.3
jbuilder >= 1.0+beta7

To build the library, on the top directory do
	$ jbuilder build
	$ jbuilder install

Data files are put under /usr/local/share/camomile by default.
The default can be overrided by running
	$ ocaml configure.ml --share=XXXX
then data files are placed under XXXX/camomile.

You can uninstall the library by
	$ jbuilder uninstall


2. Using libraries

2.1 Packing

"camomile.cma" contains three top-level modules CamomileLibrary,
CamomileLibraryDefault, CamomileLibraryDyn.  Difference of three
modules is explained below.

"camomileLibrary.cma" contains CamomileLibrary alone.
"camomileLibrary.cma" is useful if you want to dynamically load
Camomile, since loading CamomileLibraryDefault, CamomileLibraryDyn
causes side effects such as loading data files which could fail.

2.2 Configuration

Camomile requires runtime configuration.  Currently, you have to pass
the location of data files to Camomile.  In the future, more
configuration variables would be required.

Camomile's idea of configuration is "configuration by functors".
Modules which require configuration become functors parametrized by a
module which contains configuration variables.
CamomileLibrary.ConfigInt.Type specifies the module type of
configuration parameters.  You can pass the configuration module to
individual modules' Make (as UCol.Make) or Configure functors (as
CharEncoding.Configure), or pass it to the whole-in-one functor
CamomileLibrary.Make and obtain configured modules.

Camomile provides two top-level modules CamomileLibraryDefault and
which contains modules already configured.  CamomileLibraryDefault is
configured by default values determined by configure.  Therefore it is
suitable to use if you are using Camomile locally installed from the
source.  CamomileLibraryDyn is deprecated and just an alias to
CamomileLibraryDefault.
